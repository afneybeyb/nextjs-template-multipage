# NextJS multipage 1
This project was my homework from school. It is a result of [a Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/Nq3Fgk2P3uqCABfJbO70Jz/DVOP-MWA-NextJS-template-1). We were allowed to make a simpler version of it. The main goal of that homework was to get used to NextJS, learn to make multipage websites, make them responsive, and try to use [the Image component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
